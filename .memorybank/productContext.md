# Product Context

Value Proposition: Empower users to quickly assess whether an image might be AI-generated or manipulated, consolidating processing tools into an accessible UI.

Target Users (assumed):
- Content moderators / journalists / researchers
- General users curious about AI-generated imagery

Key Use Cases:
1. Drag & drop or select one or multiple images for evaluation.
2. Display detection confidence or classification metadata.
3. Review processing history / results.
4. Adjust settings (e.g., thresholds, theme preference, maybe model selection).

Differentiators (to validate): Simplicity, local privacy (processing client-side), extensibility for different detection models.

Risks / Unknowns:
- Accuracy claims without model verification.
- Legal/compliance concerns for storing user images.
# Product Context

## Target Users (Assumed)
- Journalists, researchers, or general users wanting to validate image authenticity.
- Developers experimenting with AI-driven fake image detection.

## Core User Jobs
1. Upload an image for analysis.
2. View grid of previously uploaded / processed images.
3. Adjust theme / settings (appearance, maybe detection thresholds later).
4. Inspect detection results (future feature).

## Value Proposition
Offer a simple interface that can evolve into a trustworthy image authenticity checking tool with pluggable AI detection models.

## Differentiators (Potential)
- Local-first analysis before remote submission.
- Extensible service architecture for multiple detection providers.
- Transparent scoring & explanation (future roadmap).

## Product Risks
- Model accuracy / false positives hurting trust.
- Performance issues with large images.
- Privacy concerns around image handling.
